# Hotel-Booking
School project - building a JavaEE application. We were tasked with creating a real website in a JavaEE environment that included container-based security (we used Glassfish as our container), EJB's and a relational database. It also had to adhere to a model-view-controller design and contain at least one RESTful web service. We also optionally used JPA for our connections to the database.
